Please note that SafeGraph provides one with the option of using "visitor_daytime_cbg" vs "visitor_nighttime_cbg". We opted to use "visitor_daytime_cbg" because the computation of “visitor_nighttime_cbg” was changed on May 2020, which coincided very close to the start of COVID-19. So any changes detected from COVID-19 could have very well been confounded by changes resulting from SafeGraphs methodological changes.
