Raw files are datasets which were received in raw form (ie unwrangled and uncleaned datasets)
Interim files are datasets which are temporarily stored in a file prior to cleaning and merging as part of the data wrangling process
Processed files are datasets which have been wrangled and are used to run the regression models. 

Note: Due to SafeGraph's terms of service, census-level and POI-level visitation information could not be displayed. Only broadly aggregated data could be displayed. Please contact the main author (me) if you wish to obtain any relevant interim data that was used as part of the data wrangling or analysis process. 

Details on the data types used can be referenced in the Supplemental Information of the manuscript (https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-022-16330-z/MediaObjects/41598_2022_16330_MOESM1_ESM.pdf).
