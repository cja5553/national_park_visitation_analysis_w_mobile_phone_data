Raw files are datasets which were received in raw form (ie unwrangled and uncleaned datasets)
Interim files are datasets which are temporarily stored in a file prior to cleaning and merging as part of the data wrangling process
Processed files are datasets which have been wrangled and are used to run the regression models.
